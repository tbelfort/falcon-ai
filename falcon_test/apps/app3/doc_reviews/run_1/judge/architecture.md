## Issue Details

No issues to evaluate. The Architecture Decisions Scout determined that all architecture decisions are sufficiently made:

- Technology stack is fully specified (Python 3.10+, SQLite3, argparse, standard library only)
- Architecture patterns are clearly defined (layered architecture with four distinct layers)
- Data architecture is complete (hybrid storage, full schema, FTS5 implementation)
- Security decisions are documented (SQL injection prevention, path traversal prevention, filename sanitization)
- File structure is decided (8 modules, vault structure, database location)
- Performance targets are specified for all operations
- Data model is fully defined with validation rules
- All 13 commands are completely specified
- Known limitations are explicitly documented

## Statistics

- Total issues: 0
- Blocking: 0
